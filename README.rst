Django Calendarium
==================

A Django application for managing and displaying a calendar and it's events
in your templates.

It will be heavily influenced by the awesome
`django-schedule <https://github.com/thauber/django-schedule>`_

Since that project is unfortunately no longer maintained, we will try to revive
it's ideas with TDD, class based views and AJAX in mind.

Installation
------------

You need to install the following prerequisites in order to use this app::

    pip install Django
    pip install South
    pip install python-dateutil

If you want to install the latest stable release from PyPi::

    $ pip install django-calendarium

If you feel adventurous and want to install the latest commit from GitHub::

    $ pip install -e git://github.com/bitmazk/django-calendarium.git#egg=calendarium

Add ``calendarium`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'calendarium',
    )

Run the South migrations::

    ./manage.py migrate calendarium


Usage
-----

First think about the layout you want to integrate. In most cases you might
want to add the calendar for the current month first. Reverse with::

    {% url "calendar_current_month" %}

Then use the different URLs to let the user navigate through months, weeks and
days. The event management should be intuitive. Be sure to add ``Rule`` models,
if you want to use occurences.

### Template Tags

We provide a template tag to render a defined amount of upcoming occurrences.

    {% render_upcoming_events %}

The default amount is ``5``. You can add your own::

    {% render_upcoming_events 1000 %}
